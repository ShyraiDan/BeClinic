          "answer": "It may vary, but generally speaking, the first appointment will be merely a consulting one. Our dentist or dental hygienist will be checking the overall state of your oral health. Then a dentist will provide recommendations on any further dental procedures you might need."

          "answer": "You may feel fine and think that your oral health is not at risk. But the fact is that only a professional dentist can detect dental problems in their early stages. This can only happen during a regular dental checkup. Tooth decay, food staining, gum problems, and weakening teeth are just some of the problems that can go unnoticed for a long time. In addition, you need to take advantage of all the benefits of modern dental medicine to correct any problems that you have not corrected before (e.g., broken, chipped teeth, etc.)."
